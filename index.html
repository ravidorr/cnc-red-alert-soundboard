                <h3>About Red Alert</h3>
                <p><strong>Command & Conquer: Red Alert</strong> was released on October 31, 1996 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood_Studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Westwood Studios</a> and published by Virgin Interactive. Set in an alternate timeline where Einstein prevents World War II by eliminating Hitler, the game pits the Allied Forces against the Soviet Union in a classic real-time strategy showdown.</p>
                <p>Red Alert became one of the most influential <strong>RTS games</strong> ever made, selling over 10 million copies worldwide. The game's memorable unit voices - especially <strong>Tanya's one-liners</strong> like "Shake It Baby" and "Let's Rock," plus the satisfying "Acknowledged" and "Affirmative" responses - have become iconic in gaming culture and popular internet memes.</p>
                <p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-remastered-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA released a Remastered Collection</a> with updated graphics, but this soundboard preserves the original 1996 audio - the authentic sounds that 90s gamers remember. Westwood Studios was later acquired by EA in 1998, but their legacy lives on through these classic <strong>C&C Red Alert sounds</strong>.</p>
